# godaddy-dns-sync
The purpose of this project is to periodically synchronize the external IP address of a computer with Godaddy's DNS service. Therefore the owned domain name always points to the correct IP address. This is especially helpful if the computer's network IP address changes from time to time (alias dynamic IP).
